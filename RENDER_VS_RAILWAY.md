## 🏆 Winner: Railway.app

   - Render: Spins down after 15 min inactivity (slow first request)

2. **Faster**
   - Railway: Always running, instant responses
   - Render: Needs to wake up (30-60 seconds first request)

3. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Render: Good but older interface

4. **More Reliable**

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Use Railway.app** - It's better for your use case because:
- ✅ Your backend needs to be always available (for portal automation)
- ✅ Faster response times
- ✅ Better free tier
- ✅ More modern platform

**Use Render.com if:**
- You prefer a more established platform
- You don't mind cold starts (30-60 sec delay)

## 📝 Both Are Good!

You can't go wrong with either. But **Railway is slightly better** for your needs.
